It has been over three months since the first final version of the Foundry
release has been made public. Today, I am glad to announce the release of the
6.2 version! This new version focuses on two areas of improvements:

1. [Accessibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_accessibility), and more specifically integration with _VoiceOver_ and _TalkBack_ screen readers;
2. Richer [model-based
   rendering](/docs/guides/custom-renderers#model-based-custom-rendering), and the
   feature to define React Native props from those models.

As you will discover through this reading, both are somehow related. Let's find out how!

:::info bonus
This post also covers a due overview of features introduced in the previous 6.1 minor release.

## You Might not Need a Custom Component Renderer

[Model-based rendering](/docs/guides/custom-renderers#model-based-custom-rendering) via <APIReference name="RenderHTMLProps"
member="customHTMLElementModels"/> prop has been a lightweight alternative to
custom (component) renderers since the early stages of the Foundry release.
However, it was limited to setting user agent styles (<APIReference
name="HTMLElementModel" member="mixedUAStyles" />),
although those styles could be derived from the DOM node element attributes
(the now-deprecated <APIReference name="HTMLElementModel" member="getUADerivedStyleFromAttributes" />).
The below example is a reminder on how those element models can be defined, for instance to
register a new `<blue-circle>` tag which renders to a 50 by 50 blue circle!

```js title="An Example of Model-Based Rendering"
import RenderHTML, {
  HTMLElementModel,
  HTMLContentModel
} from 'react-native-render-html';

// The eponym prop to pass to RenderHTML
const customHTMLElementModels = {
  'blue-circle': HTMLElementModel.fromCustomModel({
    tagName: 'blue-circle',
    mixedUAStyles: {
      width: 50,
      height: 50,
      borderRadius: 25,
      alignSelf: 'center',
      backgroundColor: 'blue'
    },
    contentModel: HTMLContentModel.block
  })
};
```

:::important
Keep in mind that <APIReference name="HTMLElementModel" member="mixedUAStyles"
/> has a lower specificity than styles passed to `RenderHTML` such as
&ZeroWidthSpace;<APIReference name="RenderHTMLProps" member="tagsStyles" />.
See the [CSS Processing guide](/docs/flow/css-processing#specificity) section
related to specificity for a refresher.
:::

Version 6.2 ships with a bunch of new fields for HTML element models which
should increase model-based rendering adoption. Let's take a tour!

### `getMixedUAStyles`

This field deprecates <APIReference name="HTMLElementModel"
member="getUADerivedStyleFromAttributes"/>; it serves the same purpose but its
signature has changed. It now receives the target `tnode` and DOM `element`,
which lets us implement more fine-grained logic such as CSS-selector-like
behaviors:

```js title="Conditionnaly remove margins of 'ol' direct descendents of 'p' elements."
import RenderHTML, {
  defaultHTMLElementModels,
  isDomElement
} from 'react-native-render-html';

// The eponym prop to pass to RenderHTML
const customHTMLElementModels = {
  ol: defaultHTMLElementModels.ol.extend({
    getMixedUAStyles(tnode, element) {
      if (isDomElement(element.parent) && element.parent.tagName === 'p') {
        // This is equivalent to targetting a "p > ol" CSS selector.
        return {
          marginTop: 0,
          marginBottom: 0
        };
      }
    }
  })
};
```

However and as stated before, those styles will have a lower specificity than tags, classes and
ID styles and as such, these are not "real" CSS selectors. Hopefully, CSS selectors will be
implemented at some point, [you can upvote the feature request here](https://native-html.canny.io/features/p/support-complex-css-like-selectors-eg-div-button)!
The hard challenge is that these should not impede performances. I am planning to explore this issue next year.

:::warning
Beware that this `tnode` is an instance of <APIReference name="TNodeDescriptor"
/>, which is a minimal `tnode` shape available during the Transient Render
Engine creation. You will not have access to `parent` or `children` fields,
since the hierarchy is yet in the making. This is why we are using the second
argument, `element`, to query the DOM hierarchy instead. For this very reason,
you are advised to use [`domutils`](https://github.com/fb55/domutils) library
to query the DOM and create your conditional styling rules.
:::

### `reactNativeProps`

This field holds props that will be passed to the native component during the
rendering phase. It is an object with three optional properties (for reference,
the shape of this object is a <APIReference name="ReactNativePropsDefinitions"
/>):

1. `text`, to pass native props to `Text`-backed renderers;
2. `view`, to pass native props to `View`-backed renderers;
3. `native`, to pass props to either `View` or `Text`-backed renderers.

In the next snippet, we are defining a custom tag, `<nav-widget>`, and setting
accessibility props to any underlying native component for the render phase. We
can also define `onPress`, which will cause the renderer to use the
&ZeroWidthSpace;<APIReference name="RenderHTMLProps" member="GenericPressable" /> instead of
default `View` for block renderers.

```js title="Defining React Native props in an HTML element model"
import RenderHTML, {
  HTMLContentModel,
  HTMLElementModel
} from 'react-native-render-html';

// The eponym prop to pass to RenderHTML
const customHTMLElementModels = {
  'nav-widget': HTMLElementModel.fromCustomModel({
    tagName: 'nav-widget',
    contentModel: HTMLContentModel.block,
    reactNativeProps: {
      native: {
        accessibilityRole: 'link',
        onPress() {
          console.info('Pressed the nav widget!');
        }
      }
    }
  })
};
```

However, this field is somehow limited in that it cannot depend on `tnode` attributes.
This is where <APIReference name="HTMLElementModel" member="getReactNativeProps" /> comes to the rescue!

### `getReactNativeProps`

The purpose of this field is identical to <APIReference name="HTMLElementModel"
member="reactNativeProps" /> field. It only differs in that instead of a plain
object, it is a method which takes two arguments, `tnode` (the Transient Node)
and `element` (the DOM node) and returns a plain object (see <APIReference
name="ReactNativePropsDefinitions" />).

In the example below, a custom `nav-widget` tag is registered. This time, we
are handling `onPress` events conditionally, based on attributes of the
`tnode`. The snippets uses a phony API, `appNavigatorController`, to navigate
between screens. Such API is easy to implement with a globally-defined ref to a
[`react-navigation`](https://reactnavigation.org) "navigation" object.

:::important
It is worth noting that you cannot use React hooks in those element models
functions. But you can use any ad-hoc API to emit events, and glue that logic
to hooks. If you really need React hooks, it might be simple to [create a custom
component renderer](/docs/guides/custom-renderers#component-based-custom-rendering).
:::

```js title="Defining React Native props based on the TNode in an HTML element model"
import RenderHTML, {
  HTMLContentModel,
  HTMLElementModel
} from 'react-native-render-html';
import appNavigatorController from './appNavigatorController';

// The eponym prop to pass to RenderHTML
const customHTMLElementModels = {
  'nav-widget': HTMLElementModel.fromCustomModel({
    tagName: 'nav-widget',
    contentModel: HTMLContentModel.block,
    getReactNativeProps(tnode) {
      return {
        native: {
          accessibilityRole: 'link',
          onPress() {
            const targetScreen = tnode.attributes['data-target'];
            const targetParams = tnode.attributes['data-params'];
            appNavigatorController.navigate(
              targetScreen,
              targetParams ? JSON.parse(targetParams) : null
            );
          }
        }
      };
    }
  })
};
```

Don't forget that you can mix model-based and component-based rendering!

## A Focus on Accessibility

Screen readers integration has been worked on sparsely since the Foundry
release, by addressing issues raised by the community, but until v6.2 there has
not been structural improvements to cover the full range of required features.
Thanks to the new Transient Render Engine, it has become very easy to define
translations from HTML attributes to React Native props within the engine.
Let's find out what's new!

### Support for `aria-label` and `role` Attributes

On one hand, <Reference type="html-attr" url="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques/Using_the_aria-label_attribute" name="aria-label" />
is used to hint screen readers on how a specific node **and all its descendants** should be read out loud. It is especially
useful to handle icons which don't have inner semantic meanings. This attribute has a React Native prop equivalent, namely
[`accessibilityLabel`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/accessibility#accessibilitylabel), which serves the same purpose.
On the other hand, <Reference type="html-attr" url="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles" name="role" />
informs the screen reader of the target element nature and how a user might interact with it.
This attributes roughly maps to React Native [`accessibilityRole`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/accessibility#accessibilityrole)
prop, although the set of allowed values slightly differs.
See [all supported roles and their mapping
here](https://github.com/native-html/core/blob/00c0cd1034c4cb721e991d5c02b232c4d64eae3d/packages/transient-render-engine/src/tree/TNodeCtor.ts#L33).

:::warning
Remember that a majority of interactive elements will not be rendered by this library. You must change their
content model to <APIReference name="HTMLContentModel" member="block" /> in order for them to be rendered.
Nevertheless, those interactive element models are already shipped with the appropriate `accessibilityRole` prop.
:::

The new Transient Render Engine will from now on
translate both attributes to their React Native counterparts.

### Accessible `<a>` Tags

`<a>` tags now receive an `accessibilityRole="link"` prop when their `href`
attribute is non-empty. To link that part with model enhancements seen in
the previous section, let's see now how we could set [an accessibility
hint](https://reactnative.dev/docs/accessibility#accessibilityhint) by
extending the HTML model:

```ts
import RenderHTML, { defaultHTMLElementModels } from 'react-native-render-html';

// The eponym prop to pass to RenderHTML
const customHTMLElementModels = {
  a: defaultHTMLElementModels.a.extend((aModel) => ({
    reactNativeProps: {
      native: {
        ...aModel.reactNativeProps,
        accessibilityHint: 'Open in your system web browser.'
      }
    }
  }))
};
```

Notice that <APIReference full name="HTMLElementModel" member="extend" />
method can now take a generator function. Pretty convenient to merge
nested fields!

:::warning
Because of a [React Native
bug](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/32004), nested
`Text` elements are not accessible, which means that the screen reader will not
be able to identify `<a>` tags as links when grouped with other textual
elements. Below is an example:

```html
<p>
  Unfortunately,
  <a href="https://domain.com">this hyperlink is not accessible</a>
</p>
```

Luke Walczak from Callstack [explains how to circumvent this issue in a great
post](https://callstack.com/blog/react-native-android-accessibility-tips/).
Unfortunately, this workaround cannot be genericized and we will have to wait
for an upstream fix.
:::

### Enhanced Accessibility for `<img>` Tags

`<img>` tags have been accessible since the Foundry beta. But the accessibility
props were set after the loading was complete. We have found that changing
accessibility annotations on the fly can degrade aural
experiences and have provided a fix.

:::info
`accessibilityRole="image"` will be set for `<img>` only when either `alt` or
`aria-label` attribute is present.
:::

### Accessible `<h1-6>` Tags

React Native has a “header” accessibility role which screen reader users depend
on widely to identify quickly the content hierarchy of a screen. Until this
release, `react-native-render-html` did not pass the appropriate role to
heading tags.

## Other Enhancements

### Support for `user-select` CSS property

With the new Transient Render Engine featuring React Native prop generation, it
has become very easy to pass the `selectable` prop to React Native `Text`
components based on the presence of `user-select` CSS property. Usage example:

```html
<p style="user-select: none">
  This line is not selectable.<br />
  <span>Neither is that one.</span>
</p>
```

:::important
Please not that this is not full support. The TRE will map `user-select: none;` to `selectable={false}` and
any other value to `selectable={true}`.

## Bonus: Version 6.1 Features

I didn't publish a release notes post for this version; I'm catching up
here! From now on, I will try to write up a post for each minor and major
release.

### `enableExperimentalBRCollapsing` Prop

This **recommended prop** allows consumers to circumvent a bug in the Foundry
release where line breaks (`<br>`) would be printed erroneously, such
as at the end of a paragraph. Its default it yet `false` to avoid introducing
breaking changes but it will be enabled by default in the next major
release.

:::tip learn more
Read the complete explanation for this prop [in the textual content guide](/docs/content/textual#line-breaks).
:::

### `enableExperimentalGhostLinesPrevention` Prop

This **recommended prop** allows to circumvent [a React Native
bug](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/32062) where empty `Text`
elements would be printed as ghost lines of fixed height (around 20 dpi). Its
default it yet `false` to avoid introducing breaking changes but it will be
enabled by default in the next major release.

:::tip learn more
Read the complete explanation for this prop [in the textual content guide](/docs/content/textual#empty-tags).
:::

### `provideEmbeddedHeaders` Prop

A function prop which allows to generate HTTP headers for
remote resources. It currently works with `<img>` and `<iframe>` tags (since version 2.6 of the
[`@native-html/iframe-plugin`](https://github.com/native-html/plugins/tree/master/packages/iframe-plugin#readme) library).

:::tip learn more
See for example how it can be used with images [in the image content guide](/docs/content/images#providing-headers).
:::

### `bypassAnonymousTPhrasingNodes` Prop

This prop, `true` by default, makes the React rendering layer bypass grouping
(anonymous) `TPhrasing` nodes which have only one child. It is best understood by
example. For instance, the following HTML snippet:

```html
<p>A sentence.</p>
```

will produce the below Transient Render Tree:

```xml
<TBlock tagName="p">
  <TPhrasing>
    <TText>A sentence.</TText>
  </TPhrasing>
</TBlock>
```

which by default rendering rules, would be translated to the below React render tree:

```xml
<View>
  <Text>
    <Text>A sentence.</Text>
  </Text>
</View>
```

However, when `bypassAnonymousTPhrasingNodes` prop is `true` (the default),
the render tree will be simplified to:

```xml
<View>
  <Text>A sentence.</Text>
</View>
```

This behavior is preferred for many reasons. The most simple one is that it
simplifies the render tree. The less React elements there are, the best it is
performance-wise. Moreover, there are a lot of React Native bugs related to
nested `Text` nodes, so this simplification limits the number of occurrences
of those bugs.
