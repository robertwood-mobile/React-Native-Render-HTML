The Foundry Release beta is out, and I wanted to show you its powerful
capabilities with a very common use-case: rendering an article from
a CMS. The screen we are going to implement will feature:

- An aside table of content displayed in a drawer menu, autogenerated with a pre-rendering phase;
- A scroll-to-section feature when pressing a drawer menu entry.

Now, let's get to the heart of it.
