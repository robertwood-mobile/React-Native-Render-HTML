After seven months of alpha development on my free time, I am proud to announce
the first beta release of React Native Render HTML.

An overview of the new features:

- Custom renderers as components;
- White-space collapsing;
- Awesome new list component including [access to 47 markers presets](https://github.com/jsamr/react-native-li/tree/master/packages/counter-style#readme) for custom [CSS Counter Styles](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-counter-styles-3/); support for `list-style-type` CSS property, `start` attribute and optional RTL mode;
- A brand new CSS engine overcoming recurring bugs with mismatching between CSS and React Native styles;
- A predictable, inspectable while hackable transient render tree structure and engine;
- The ability to define custom **content models** for tags (say hello to inline images!);
- A hackable image renderer which supports `object-fit`; you can reuse pieces of the renderer in your own custom image renderer!
- A three-layer rendering architecture for best performance when rendering many HTML snippets at a time;
- The ability to select the root of the document to render;
- The ability to inspect the DOM object asynchronously before rendering;

Along comes a brand new website, and the **Discovery App** which features all
the docs of the website with embedded RNRH-rendered snippets. In addition, the
Discovery App has a collection of "Playgrounds" to play with specific
components and observe how they respond to style and props changes.
