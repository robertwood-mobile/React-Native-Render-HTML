It has been over two months since the first final version of the Foundry
released has been made public.

## You Might not Need a Custom Component Renderer Anymore

Model-based custom rendering via `customHTMLElementModels` prop has been a
lightweight alternative to custom (component) renderers since the early stages
of the Foundry release. However, it was limited to setting user agent styles
(`mixedUAStyles`), although those styles could be derived from the DOM node
element attributes (`getUADerivedStyleFromAttributes`).

```js title="An Example of Model-Based Rendering"
const customHTMLElementModels = {
  'blue-circle': HTMLElementModel.fromCustomModel({
    tagName: 'blue-circle',
    mixedUAStyles: {
      width: 50,
      height: 50,
      borderRadius: 25,
      alignSelf: 'center',
      backgroundColor: 'blue'
    },
    contentModel: HTMLContentModel.block
  })
};
```

Version 6.2 ships with a bunch of new properties for HTML element models which
should make model-based custom rendering much more prevalent. Let's take a tour!

### `getUADynamicMixedStyles`
